Lesshy pronounced (less)(hy) not like fleshy. im a linux coder currently developing a remake of cathook called lesshook. werid name huh? correct! its true to the name. features are removed and specific aspects you knew of cathook are gone here. <br><br> why? simple! lesshook is (less) memory reliant, means you can run more bots via our custom lessbot runner(actually custom codede and not cathooks), it also is less laggy in game this appoints to warp, fakelag, rapidfire, and fake latency its very good and was handled through almost 72 backups to get here.
